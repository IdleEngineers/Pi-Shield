## Here Be Dragons

We want to get the project in front of people, but be warned, we have bugs in our current design. Version 1.0.0 is only partially functional due to some physical problems in our design.

We are currently troubleshooting the problems and fixing the design for version 1.1.0. You can see current details by following our [Pi Shield blog](http://idle.to/1).
